# NYC Subway Headway Prediction

Real-time headway prediction for A, C, E subway lines at West 4th Street-Washington Square station.

---

This repo is under construction.  Feel free to brows the code to gain insight on direction and architecture choices.

The project includes batch ingestion for historical data, real time event processing infrastructure and ml training and prediction serving infrastructure.  All of this will integrate into an application layer to serve predictions to subway passengers.  

I expect the project to last a few more weeks from today, which is Jan 31, 2026.  Once complete, I will provide a detailed overview of all architecture with completed code.

Please feel free to contact me if you have any questions.
