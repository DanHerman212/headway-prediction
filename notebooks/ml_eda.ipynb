    "- **Lookback window:** 10-15 previous events (based on distribution analysis)\n",

    "- Same architecture, different weights\n",
    "- Loss: MSE (fewer outliers, more regular)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Rationale:** \n",
    "- Different service patterns (2x frequency difference)\n",
    "- Weekend impact differs dramatically (28% vs 69%)\n",
    "- Allows per-track optimization\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Option B: Single Model with Track Feature\n",
    "- Add `track` as binary feature (0=A1, 1=A3)\n",
    "- May require more capacity to learn distinct patterns\n",
